## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create an animated slider with vanilla JS and make it as accessible as possible.

### Continued development

Learning how to include/use accessibility in all my projects.

### Useful resources

- [Javascript course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course) - A section in the course is about building modern components including a slider. This is a newly found technique that I'll keep using and improving on projects that require creating a vanilla JS slider.
